              Mike Patey was born in Gresham, Oregon, along with twin brother,
              Mark, right in the middle of 11 children. He and his wife,
              Chandra, who is a pilot as well, have 4 children. His aviation
              journey began in a 1971 Cessna 172L in 2002. He subsequently
              earned his single/multi-engine land and sea, commercial,
              instrument, and rotorcraft ratings along with various
              endorsements. His natural energy and knack for engineering feed
              his love for the challenge to circumvent the norms and “build it
              better.” This drives his passion to create and build his own
              airplanes, which he uses for competitive racing, STOL, flying his
              family, business, and playing with his fellow “Flying Cowboys.” He
              holds several aviation records and enthusiastically shares his
              process and adventures via his YouTube channel.

              Born in Gresham, Oregon, in 1972, Mark started life as a
              high-energy, curious child. Mark has built multiple successful
              companies, starting the first at the age of 15 and employing
              hundreds by the age of 21. Mark is an identical twin and lives in
              Spanish Fork, Utah, with his wife and four sons. Mark and his
              family currently own and operate Best Tugs employing hundreds as
              they manufacture the best general aviation tugs on the market. If
              you’re in need of an aircraft tug, Best Tugs is the best out
              there. Past achievements have included building several other
              successful businesses, both large and small. He was the host of
              his own motorsports show on ESPN, and is consistently rated as one
              of the top presenters and trainers in the country. Mark enjoys
              collecting, building, and flying airplanes, and donates his time

              Jason Sneed was born in Pensacola, Florida. His love of flight
              began early, thanks to both of his grandfathers. One gave him his
              first taste in a v-tail Bonanza at the age of 18 months and as he
              grew older, he was able to work on his other grandfather’s
              full-sized MD F-4J Phantom II Blue Angel replica in his garage. By
              age 13, Jason had earned enough money cleaning yards to purchase a
              Commodore 64, which he used to practice proficiency in instrument
              flying. In 1999, he completed training in his Cessna 140 and has
              since acquired instrument and multi-engine commercial ratings.
              With 2 airplane builds under his belt, a Rans S7S, and a Carbon
              Cub, he is currently working on “Deception”, a 330 hp Carbon Cub.
              He is a member of the “Flying Cowboys” and has a profound passion
              for flying, which he shares with everyone he meets as well as on
              his YouTube channel, found under “Jason Sneed.”

              Kevin Quinn is a flying freak…seriously. It’s about all he thinks
              about, and how to do it SAFELY! Kevin is a former professional
              hockey player and played in the ECHL, WCHL, WHL with brief stints
              in the IHL and AHL. He retired in 1995 and started pursuing his
              aviation and ski life. Kevin allocates time between flying
              airplanes, running his heli-ski operation in Alaska (Points North
              24 years), and spending as much time in the ocean at his other
              home in Kauai, HI. Of course time with his family is the most
              important to him. Kevin has been flying since he was a kid with
              his father and relatives growing up in Alaska. Kevin has an FAA
              Commercial Flight Instructor (CFI) certificate with an instrument
              rating and currently has just under 9000 hours of total time, most
              in the off-airport environment. Additionally, he’s an EMT/
              Wilderness medicine trainer, Avalanche Educator, and former
              President of U.S. Heli Ski Association (8 years) and is a
              Certified Heli-Ski Guide Trainer. He created the High Sierra
              Fly-in (11 years running now) and created STOL Drag, which is also
              the newest class of racing at Reno. He is a member of The Flying
              Cowboys and recently purchased a 1944 Stearman. To say he is
              passionate about aviation would be an understatement. Sharing his
              passions with others is something that he looks forward to daily.
              He will fly just about anything he can get his hands on: Airplane,
              Glider (sailplane) Paraglider, Powered Paragliger, Skydive, Speed
              Wing, you name it. He has been fortunate to fly a number of
              different aircraft including Helio Couriers, Super Cubs, Cessnas
              (152, 172, 170, 180, 182, 185, 206), Beaver, Maule, Highlander,
              Stretch SuperStol, and few Cirrus aircraft. His newest passion is
              Biplanes and the history that goes with them, recently being
              checked out in a Navy N3N biplane and then a Stearman. His passion
              really is landing bush planes above 9000' daily. He is an EAA
              Young Eagles Pilot with nearly 100 kids flown to dates, and that
              number changes almost weekly. Safety and training is his primary
              responsibility in life. As a father of two children (6&10) and
              married to his beautiful wife Jessica (together now over 20 years
              and she lets him fly with her full support), Kevin is set on
              safely accessing the backcountry and training others to do so as
              well. Making good pilots better is his mission. His Instagram is
              @STOLPilot and he also runs several Facebook groups including Big
              Tire Backcountry Flier Page, STOL Pilot, and Points North Heli
              pages.

              Steve really enjoys competing in STOL Drag and STOL events while
              also flying the extreme backcountry. Steve started flying in 2003
              in his hometown of Nampa, Idaho and built his first Just Aircraft
              Highlander in 2004, becoming dealers for them in 2010. Steve is
              constantly thinking up new ways he can make these already amazing
              planes perform even better. After making a YouTube video of a dead
              stick take off on one of the steep hills in his area, flying two
              miles and 1500 feet down to a river bed with no engine running,
              and landing, he got a lot of folk's attention. He flew his 2014
              Just Aircraft SuperSTOL to Valdez and finished third behind Frank
              Knapp and Josh Peppered. Steve also placed first at the STOL
              Competitions at Oshkosh in 2017 and 2018 and got a close second
              place at High Sierra in 2019. He won the High Sierra Fly-In STOL
              Drag in 2016 and had a very, very close second in 2017, as well as
              the second-best time next to DRACO in 2018. Needless to say, Steve
              is a tough competitor at STOL Drag! Steve also received the
              Charles Lindbergh Reserve Grand Champion Award at EAA AirVenture
              for Light Sport Plane in 2018 with Yee-Haw 6 and won it again in
              2019 with Yee-Haw 7. Both planes have Yamaha engines with SkyTrax
              PSRU. Steve can’t say enough of the Edge Performance's EPeX Yamaha
              300 HP engine in Yee-Haw 7, it’s truly a beast. Steve is always
              open to chatting about Highlanders, and if you ever have questions
              he’s happy to chat. Check out his YouTube channel and webpage

              Trent Palmer started his aviation career flying drones. When the
              FAA came out with new regulations in 2014, the change inspired
              Palmer to get his pilots license in order to comply with the new
              rules. Terrified of flying and heights, the opportunity was not
              something that excited Trent. However, by the time his training
              complete, he was already on the hunt for an airplane he could
              afford…and thus was born the Freedom Fox.Trent has enjoyed being
              involved in both STOL demonstrations at Oshkosh, as well as STOL
              Drag at Reno and High Sierra Fly-In, where he took 2nd place only
              to Draco.

              Creighton King loves flying and building airplanes. Born into an
              aviation lineage from the 1920’s, Creighton soloed on his 16th
              birthday and has been flying ever since. He has a fantastic bride
              Tonya, 2 teenage daughters, 2 dogs, and 3 airplanes. Creighton
              owns a 56 piper Tripacer he learned to fly in, a Cassutt Racer
              that he has improved through the years to gain nearly 50 mph in
              Reno, and an experimental Cub. His buddies lovingly called the cub
              Rusty, and it stuck. His Dad built it and Creighton helped finish
              it and that cub has continued to fly for 27 years until bending in
              a big cross wind crash on a beach. Creighton is currently
              rebuilding “Rusty” and making it even better. Rusty was flying
              before the other Cowboys and may have a bit of rust, but after the
              rebuild it should fly very well. Creighton is pretty good at TIG
              Welding as well as building light weight carbon parts. He likes to
              cover with Stits fabric and paint with a Harbor Freight paint gun.
              He is also the inventor of www.GripLockTies.com; Releasable
              Rubber-Lined Zip Ties. He spends his days working to build the
              company and help eliminate crappy zip ties from the planet.

              Hal lives in the desert of Elko, NV. In April of 2020 after
              working 45 years on large mining and construction equipment, Hal
              finally decided to retire and now devotes his time solely to
              aviation and his love for Rotax engines. Hal’s love for aviation
              spans decades. In 1995, he and his brother-in-law built an
              ultralight, and was the first time Hal discovered experimental
              aircraft. In 1999, Hal bought his first Rans S-7, which he enjoyed
              tinkering with to pull more and more power out of. In 2010 he
              started working with Rotax engines, which he also modified and
              altered to produce even more power. With his latest project, Lawn
              Mower 3, Hal enjoys competing in STOL competitions, and having
              that extra power on such a light aircraft makes a huge difference.
              Flying and working on little airplanes is all Hal wants to do with
              his retirement time, and he’s having a blast. He has over 4000
              hours in Ran S-7 airplanes alone, and hopes to get many more.

              Scott Palmer is a 3rd generation aviator to say it’s in his blood
              would be an understatement. Formerly a TACP/Forward Air Controller
              with the USAF after serving his country during Operation Iraqi
              Freedom Scott pursued the sport of skydiving with an unrelenting
              focus. Over 15 years and 11,000 skydives Scott has traveled the
              world competing, teaching, and creating a unique sub-discipline
              within the Indoor and outdoor skydiving scenes. He has multiple
              world records and championship titles and is a highly sought after
              coach for the emerging Indoor Skydiving discipline. After reaching
              the pinnacle of skydiving Scott changed his focus from flying his
              body to flying airplanes. Now a Commercial Pilot with an
              instrument rating when not refining his skills flying his Modified
              Kitfox IV you will find him flying a Turbine, Crop Dusting. Follow
